## The Best App for PICTians to check attendance

* Check your Attendance without the hassle of using the slow PICT MIS Login

## How does the app look?
#### Drop Dead Gorgeous. Seriously.

## How does it work?
#### Not Rocket Science. 
1. Send an http request to the authentication url with the username and password
2. Send a http request to the My Profile url
3. Parse the html page that is returned
4. Make it look good!

## How much time did you need to develop this?
#### We developed this app over a weekend in February 2015. We didn't release this till about August 2015, when it was leaked. :D

## Can I modify this code and build my own version?
#### Yes. Go Crazy. If you build something epic, send us some screenshots on hinge.weone@gmail.com
